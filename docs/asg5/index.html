	<p id="mainP">This is my work done for the fifth project. It uses Markov Models to generate random music (or random notes). It takes in the midi file I downloaded online and analyzes the notes in it to form a possibility table for which note is likely to come after a certain note. Each time the user refreshes the website it will generate a random piece of "music".   </p><br>
	<p2>I am using 200 piece of midi files at max as anything higher than that will crash my Chrome.</p2><br>
