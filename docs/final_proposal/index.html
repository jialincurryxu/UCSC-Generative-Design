	<h1 id="title">UCSC-Generative-Design-Final-Proposal</h1>
	<p id="mainP">The reason I am creating this experience is because I got into the world of midi launchpad since high school and when I see the first assignment it reminds me of it. I will try to create a visual representation of what you are pressing on the keyboard and also sync it with sound effect to make you feel like a DJ. I think my experience will contain more of a WOW factor. </p>
	<p>The experience will start with nothing happening on the screen and with the person pressing the keyboard it will have soundd effects and visual effects. The style as I wanty to make the experience feel cool, it will be electronic music and neon color. I want to create with something somewhat like the video shown, but with P5 sound analyzed visual effects instead of pre-programmed ones. Yes it will be ineractive and user will interact with their keyboard. </p><br>

	<p>I am going to use generative grammars or cellular automata, I will find out which one is more applyable. I want to use these generatives and when the user pressed enough keys the program can generate the music alike the user created.</p>

	<p>Schedule:</p>
	<p>Week 6: Finish the interactive visual & sound effects to let me have a ground to work with.</p>
	<p>Week 7: Find out which method to use and try to make it work.</p>
	<p>Week 8: Finish up and polish.</p>
