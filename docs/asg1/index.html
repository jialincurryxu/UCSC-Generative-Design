	<p id="mainP">This is my work done for the sirst project. It uses p5.js, p5.sound.js & p5.dom.js to represent the music with on screen particles. There are 1024 partiles spread across the x axis, and each of them represents the amplitude of the music on the given frequency, being lowest on the left and highest on the right. The particles will become bigger and slower when the amplitude is higher, smaller and faster when opposite. </p><br>
	<p2>I was not so clear with the requirement and thought we can make something just like the img on canvas, so I will take the penalty of not reading the requirement carefully this time.</p2><br>
